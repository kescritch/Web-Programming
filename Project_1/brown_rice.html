        <ul>
          <li>Richer in fiber</li>
          <li>White rice undergoes more processing, having its husk, bran, and germ removed, while brown rice only has its outer husk removed.</li>
          <li>Brown rice has a chewier texture and a nuttier flavor, while white rice is softer and more neutral in taste.</li>
          <li>White rice has a longer shelf life due to the removal of the bran and germ, which contain oils that can turn rancid, whereas brown rice spoils faster.</li>
